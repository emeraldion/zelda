<h2>Speaking</h2>

<p>Here is a selection of decks and recordings from my public speaking activity. I sometimes speak at tech meetups and user groups, and rarely at conferences. I also like to go out to schools and technology fairs to advocate <acronym title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics">STEM</acronym> careers and increase participation by girls, underrepresented minorities, and special needs children.</p>

	<h3>Smart Futures - Engineers Ireland</h3>
	<div class="lighter">Dublin, March 28, 2011</div>

	<p>My talk on engineering careers given at a secondary school in Ballsbridge, Dublin during <a href="http://www.engineersweek.ie/" class="external">Engineers Week 2011</a>.</p>

	<p>I volunteered for Engineers Ireland to go to schools and talk to pupils about the profession of the engineer, telling my story and background, in order to introduce more students to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) college subjects.</p>

	<p>It was fun! I had lots of questions by pupils. I'd recommend it to everyone. Also a great chance for me to understand what I do and why, in order to explain it to others :-)</p>
