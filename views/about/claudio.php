<h2>About Claudio</h2>
<p>
	Hey there, nice to meet you! I'm Claudio, a full stack software developer with a keen interest for the open web, privacy, security, and IoT.
</p>
<h3>What I do</h3>
<p>
  I'm currently making monitoring awesome at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS</a>.
  Previously, I made enterprise social awesome at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/social" target="_blank">IBM</a>.
  I also took a short sabbatical between the two. Read more on my <a href="https://claudiopro.github.io/resume/" target="_blank">resume</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I like being involved with the developers community and contributing to open source when I can (and my employer allows).
  Find me at local meetups and tech conferences, I usually attend and sometimes speak too.
</p>
