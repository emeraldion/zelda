<h2>About Claudio</h2>
<p>
  Hey there, nice to meet you! I'm Claudio, a full stack software developer with a keen interest for the open web, privacy, security, and IoT.
</p>
<p>
  When I'm not coding, I'm probably sketching something on my notebooks, exploring nature or humanity with my camera, or cooking lovely food for friends.
</p>
<h3>What I do</h3>
<p>
  I'm currently taking a short break after spending a year making monitoring awesome at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS</a>.
  Previously, I spent seven years building the foundations of enterprise social collaboration at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/social" target="_blank">IBM</a>.

</p>
<p>
  I like being involved with the developers community and contributing to open source whenever I can.
  Find me at local meetups and tech conferences. I usually attend, and sometimes speak too.
