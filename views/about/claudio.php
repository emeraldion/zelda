<h2>About Claudio</h2>
<p>
	I&rsquo;m a thirty-something year old guy, living across Palermo, Italy and Dublin, Ireland.
	Before living for a few years in Ireland, I spent a year in Spain during my uni, and soon
	realized that I&rsquo;d like to live in too many places at once. Lack of ubiquity sucks!
	Let&rsquo;s please invent teleportation soon.
</p>
<p>
	I speak Italian, English and Spanish fluently, and know just a little of German, Turkish and Greek.
	I enjoy hanging out with creative, lively, true people, as a result I&rsquo;m always rounded by geeks and artists.
	I believe happiness is only real when shared, and life is all about emotions, creating bonds, and building great memories together.
	I like unselfish friendship. Knowing different cultures and traditions. Expressing thoughts and ideas. Traveling, and enjoying the journey.
</p>
<p>
	I truly believe in the value of the community, as a network of individuals to learn and be inspired from, and to work together to make
	even the craziest ideas become real. I eagerly participate in local meetups, and often speak or mentor new speakers.
	Over the years I came across and made friends with the most talented and brilliant individuals at meetups, conferences and events,
	and am one of those who save for tickets for events just to be able to chat with fellow developers from all over the world.
	Possibly in front of a beer :-D.
<p>
	I made this site as a container for everything I make: my blog containing a mix of technical articles, rants, and
	a few short stories, my art, my photos and my travel diaries. And also the projects I started or I&rsquo;m contributing to,
	and the code I write.
</p>

<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>
	At the moment I&rsquo;m taking a short career break after a streak of seven years in the same job (gasp).
	Catching up with the web development community, giving back the love.
</p>
<p>
	From July 2008 to August 2015 I worked for IBM in Ireland in the Lotus brand, which was later rebranded IBM Collaboration Solutions and
	subsequently Enterprise Social Solutions division. During that time, I led a team that developed web applications for IBM&rsquo;s flagship
	enterprise social solution, IBM Connections. I worked with JavaScript, HTML and CSS and often dived in the guts of the platform coding
	with J2EE. During my last year I was given the opportunity to set the direction of the front-end for the entire product,
	I also went out giving talks to partners and customers, and participated into conferences, user groups, and STEM events.
	I made great friends and created personal and professional bonds that last to day.
</p>
<p>
	Before then, I had a blast developing Mac OS X applications in the long tail of the Delicious generation.
	My utilities reached some popularity among Mac users and, even though I don&rsquo;t have time to maintain them anymore,
	I still receive feedback from users from time to time.
	I somewhat missed the chance to become a millionaire not joining the iOS development bandwagon early, but I don&rsquo;t regret it
	as I much prefer the web, its open standards and awesome community to proprietary native apps.
