<h2>About Claudio</h2>
<p>
	I&rsquo;m a thirty-something year old guy, living across Palermo, Italy and Dublin, Ireland.
	Before living for a few years in Ireland, I spent a year in Spain during my uni, and soon
	realized that I&rsquo;d like to live in too many places at once. Lack of ubiquity sucks!
	Let&rsquo;s please invent teleportation soon.
</p>
<p>
	I speak Italian, English and Spanish fluently, and know just a little of German, Turkish and Greek.
	I enjoy hanging out with creative, lively, true people, as a result I&rsquo;m always rounded by geeks and artists.
	I believe happiness is only real when shared, and life is all about emotions, creating bonds, and building great memories together.
	I like unselfish friendship. Knowing different cultures and traditions. Expressing thoughts and ideas. Traveling, and enjoying the journey.
</p>
<p>
	I made this site as a container for everything I make: my blog containing a mix of technical articles, rants, and
	a few short stories, my art, my photos and my travel diaries. And also the projects I started or I&rsquo;m contributing to,
	and the code I write.
</p>

<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>
	At the moment I&rsquo;m taking a short career break after a streak of seven years in the same job (gasp).
	Catching up with the web development community, giving back the love.
</p>
<p>
	From July 2008 to August 2015 I worked for IBM in Ireland across a few reorgs &mdashl; first in the Lotus brand,
	then in the IBM Collaboration Solutions division, finally in the Enterprise Social Solutions division. During that time,
	I developed enterprise social web applications with JavaScript, HTML and CSS and often dived in the guts of the platform coding with J2EE.
	I went out giving talks to partners and customers, and participated into conferences.
	I made great friends and created personal and professional bonds that last to day.
</p>
<p>
	Before then, I had a blast developing Mac OS X applications in the long tail of the Delicious generation.
	My utilities reached some popularity among Mac users and, even though I don&rsquo;t have time to maintain them anymore,
	I still receive feedback from users from time to time.
	I somewhat missed the chance to become a millionaire not joining the iOS development bandwagon early, but I don&rsquo;t regret it
	as I much prefer the web, its open standards and awesome community to proprietary native apps.
