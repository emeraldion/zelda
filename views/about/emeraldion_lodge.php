<h2>About the Emeraldion Lodge</h2>
<p>
  This website hosts <del>my rants, my attempts at bridging dimensions of spacetime, and my lame attempts at making a dent in the universe</del>
  my blog, my software projects, and recordings and decks of my tech talks. I use it as a playground to test new things out, so it's sometimes
  badly broken or in the middle of refactoring, so bear with me if this happens while you visit.
