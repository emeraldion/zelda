<h2><a target="_blank" href="//emerails.emeraldion.it">EmeRails</a></h2>
<h4>A lightweight Rails-like web application framework and ORM written in PHP.</h4>
<p>
  A few years ago I wrote a lightweight clone of Ruby on Rails, by replicating much
  of the ActiveRecord model class, and a convention-based MVC development model.
  I struggled against the syntactical and practical limitations of the PHP language,
  but at the end I had a working framework in less than a month.
  EmeRails supports page caching, action filtering and a lot of useful features
  that save coding time and server load.

<h2><a target="_blank" href="/software/macosx/minibatterylogger.html">MiniBatteryLogger</a></h2>
<h4>A Mac OS X application designed to monitor the battery and log all power events.</h4>
<p>
  MiniBatteryLogger is a Mac OS X application that monitors laptop batteries,
  traces the graph of charge and current over time, compares and rates the performance
  of batteries among users, logs all power events and alerts the user with Growl notifications.
  Since I am not currently maintaining this project, I released it as open source so people
  can contribute and add support for new models and recent OSs.

<h2><a target="_blank" href="http://burgos.emeraldion.it/mbl/">MiniBatteryLogger Shared Battery Data Archive</a></h2>
<h4>A collection of battery stats, organized by computer and battery model, produced by MiniBatteryLogger.</h4>
<p>
  The Shared Battery Data Archive is a collection of battery statistics, organized by computer model, for Apple
  Macintosh laptop computers. It is a free resource for anybody to lookup, to evaluate the performance of own
  batteries, to elaborate statistics on battery life, power consumption, etc. Data is presented hierarchically.
  You can browse the list of models, which shows the number of available entries grouped by computer model,
  and then choose a particular model to browse all the actual entries.

<h4>A simple game implemented as a single-page JS application.</h4>
<p>
  Project Mandarine is a simple 2D game implemented with JavaScript. Sprites were hand drawn (sigh!)
  and acquired with a scanner. The game location is a classroom at my high school :-).

<h4>A widget to send free SMS messages through carriers&rsquo; web sites in a convenient way.</h4>
<p>
  WebSMS automates the tedious task of sending free text messages through the carriers&rsquo; websites,
  which often require authenticating and clicking through a few pages. It is integrated with the
  Address Book with autocompletion for easy access to recipients, and securely stores account passwords
  in the system Keychain.
