# Emeraldion Lodge (codename Zelda)

This is an [EmeRails](https://github.com/emeraldion/emerails) instance that backs the [Emeraldion Lodge](http://www.emeraldion.it) website.

# Development

Run tests (limited coverage):

```sh
make test
```

# Documentation

To generate documentation, you will need [Doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen.git). You can build it from sources, download a binary, or install it via [homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install doxygen
```

Once you have Doxygen, you can run the `docs` target:

```sh
make docs
```
